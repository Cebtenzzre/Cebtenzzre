# Hi, I'm "Cebtenzzre"

## About Me
- I'm a self-taught programmer from upstate NY.
- I have written many lines of C++14 and Python 3 and a million shell snippets.
- I use Linux every day and know my way around its internals.
- Sometimes I dabble in electronic engineering; it's fun to build circuits around an Arduino Uno or Beaglebone.
- I listen to old music, indie music, and meme music&mdash;the more obscure, the better.
